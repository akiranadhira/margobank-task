Hi, take a look at my Microservices project for RESTful API 

Before trying it out on your local remember these are the basic things to be installed:
1. IDE 
2. Postman 
3. Keycloak (https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-zip)
4. Java

Feel free to ask on my linkedin or instagram if u have inquiries or even better things to tell.
Thank you.
